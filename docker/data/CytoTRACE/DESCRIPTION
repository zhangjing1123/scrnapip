Description: CytoTRACE is a computational framework that leverages single-cell gene counts, covariant gene expression, and local neighborhoods of transcriptionally similar cells to predict ordered differentiation states from scRNA-seq data. This package predicts the order of cellular differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data.
